# Extension Gallery

## Submitting an extension
### Step 1.
Create your extension. You can find a lot of details [here](https://docs.turbowarp.org/development/extensions/introduction).

#### Important notes:
- Your extension should not already exist on the gallery. Please check the
[Pull Requests](https://github.com/PenguinMod/PenguinMod-ExtensionsGallery/pulls)
and [Gallery page](https://penguinmod-extensions-gallery.vercel.app/) to confirm.
- Your extension should be created for a specific purpose. An extension with random blocks someone might need will likely not get accepted if the blocks are not in a certain theme, like math or rendering.
- Your extension should be easily explainable in 1-2 sentences or a single picture. This is what will determine whether you can be on the gallery or not.
- Your extension should be MIT licensed (not compatible with the MIT license, should be the actual MIT license. This may change in the future.)

### Step 2.
Create info for your extension, like a description and a banner / thumbnail.
The banner / thumbnail is not required, but it will be a solid color if not provided.

Your banner / thumbnail must also be MIT licensed (basically just make it yourself and the image should be usable anywhere)

### Step 3.
Add your extension in the `static/extensions` folder.

Open [this link](https://github.com/PenguinMod/PenguinMod-ExtensionsGallery/tree/main/static/extensions) in a new tab to open the folder.

Click `Add File` at the top and click `Create new file`.

GitHub will likely tell you to make a fork to do this step. Make sure to create one as you'll need to have the files somewhere.

Create a new folder with your **Scratch** username. You can do this by typing the username as the file name, and then typing a `/`. Then type the actual file name, followed by `.js`.

Now, paste your extension's code into the file.
You should now be able to `Commit changes` or `Create a pull request`, it'll likely be a green button.

### Step 4.
Create the pull request.

Continue through the menus until it lets you create a pull request.

You can post your extension banner / thumbnail and or description in the pull request.

Once your pull request is merged, it'll be on the site. You may get responses about things you should change or fix though.
