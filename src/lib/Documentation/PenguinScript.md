# PenguinScript
PenguinScript is a programming language designed to be used with PenguinMod. 
This document will explain the syntax, and the global functions.

## Syntax

This section will cover the syntax of PenguinScript.

### Basic values

You can use number digits to create a number.

`1234567890.1234567890` is a valid number.
`1e+10` is not (we will cover how to do this later).

You can create "strings" (which are pieces of text) using string literals.
String literals are pieces of text wrapped inside double quotes.
`"this is some really, really cool text"` is a valid string.
You can also use "escape sequences" in strings, which are a letter (or symbol) that follows a backslash (this character: \\ ).
Escape sequences let you type characters that are inconvenient (or impossible) to type.
Here are the escape sequences:
|What to type| What you get                                                                                                                                                                   |
