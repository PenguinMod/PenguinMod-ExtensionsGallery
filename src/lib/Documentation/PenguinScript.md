# PenguinScript
PenguinScript is a programming language designed to be used with PenguinMod. 
This document will explain the syntax, and the global functions.

## Syntax

This section will cover the syntax of PenguinScript.

### Basic values

You can use number digits to create a number.

`1234567890.1234567890` is a valid number.
`1e+10` is not (we will cover how to do this later).

You can create "strings" (which are pieces of text) using string literals.
String literals are pieces of text wrapped inside double quotes.
`"this is some really, really cool text"` is a valid string.
You can also use "escape sequences" in strings, which are a letter (or symbol) that follows a backslash (this character: \\ ).
Escape sequences let you type characters that are inconvenient (or impossible) to type.
Here are the escape sequences:
|What to type| What you get                                                                                                                                                                   |

| \\b        | A backspace character (note: it doesn't behave like you expect)                                                                                                   |

You can also use true or false by typing in `true` or `false`.
There is also a special value called `null`.

### Local Variables

You can define variables that are only accessible inside the the script using a special syntax. Note that these variables are scoped.

`let`, then followed by an identifier (a piece of text with only letters, numbers, and underscores, however, an identifier cannot start with a number to avoid confusion)
then optionally followed by an equals sign and an expression (a fancy word for value).

You can mutate this variable later on using identifier = value. 

To prevent mutation, you can use const instead of let (note that the optional equals sign and expression becomes mandatory).

Defining a variable is a statement; it is like this:

```scratch
Statement
```

Note that all statements (except control flow and braces) require a semicolon at the end of them.

### Operations

Operators allow you to create complex expressions (complex values like x + y, x * y, x mod y)

You can use some operators from PenguinMod in PenguinScript, along with some new ones. (this list will state them in order of precedence, with the first being the lowest)

|Operator(s)|Example Usage|Notes|Associativty
|--------|-------------|-----|-----------|
| = | `x = y` | Sets an assignable value (an identifier or global identifier (we will explore later)) to a different value|Right-Left
| and | `x and y` | Returns the first operand that is falsy (null or false), and if none are, always return the second one.|Left-Right
| xor | `x xor y` | If the both operands are falsy, return the second one, if only one is truthy (not null or false) return that operand, if both are truthy return false.|Left-Right
| or | `x or y` | Returns the first operand that is truthy, and if both are false, always return the second one.|Left-Right
| < > == <= >= | `x < y` | All of these operators (except for ==) convert their operands to numbers. < is less than, > is greater than, == is exactly equals to, <= is less than or equal to, >= is greater than or equal to.|Left-Right
| not | `not x` | If the value is falsy, return true, otherwise, return false. | Right-Left
| + - | `x + y` | Converts both operands into numbers, and does the arithmetic (addition + or subtraction -). | Left-right
| * / % | `x * y` | Converts both operands into numbers, and does the arithmetic (multiplication *, division /, or mod %)|Left-right
| ^ | `x ^ y` | Converts both operands into numbers, and raises the first operand to the second. | Right-Left
| (arg1, arg2, arg3... argN) | `x(arg1, arg2, arg3... argN)` | Executes the function (we will discuss them later) on the left of the args list with the args list.|Left-Right

### Control flow

There are special statements that can control the flow of your program (expr stands for expression, and stmt stands for statement):

`if expr stmt else if expr stmt... else stmt`

`while expr stmt`

`repeatUntil expr stmt`

`forever stmt`

The first one works as you expect, as it allows you conditionally execute things.

The second is repeat until not expr, and the third is repeat until expr, and the last one just executes the code forever. (these are loops)

Note that you cannot declare a variable without braces (these -> {stmt1; stmt2; stmt3; ... stmtN;}) when using these statements.

You can also break out of loops using the `break` keyword, and go to the next iteration of the loop using the `continue` keyword.

### Braces

Braces allow you to define a new scope, and also execute multiple statements where only one would be expected.

The syntax for braces are {stmt1; stmt2; stmt3; ... stmtN;}

### Functions

Functions are similar to custom blocks, as they can be used to create reusable code.

Unlike in PenguinMod, all functions are inline (which means that they aren't statements).

To create a function, you would do `fn`, followed by an optional identifier (which refers to the function from within the function), an parameter list which is (param1, param2, param3... paramN) where paramN can be replaced with an identifier and then a function body, which are statements inside curly braces.

### Return

In order to make the evaluate block return a value, you must return a value from not within any functions.

Return can also be used to make a function (or inline statements) return a value.

The syntax is `return` followed by a value, then followed by a semicolon.

### Inline

Inline allows you to execute statements from within an expression, kind of similar to a block with a similar name in controls expansion.

The syntax for inline is `inline`, then followed by a statement.

Inline is for really complicated expressions.

### Target

There is a special value called `target` and it contains the sprite that evaluated the code.

It isn't really useful, but can be used with the global functions discussed below.
