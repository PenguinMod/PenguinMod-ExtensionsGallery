# Boxed Physics
<!-- Based on https://p7scratchextensions.pages.dev/ext/BoxedPhysics/doc.md but re-worked to be compatable with normal markdown parsers -->

Boxed Physics is an implementation of the Box2D physics engine that allows for the use of joints, springs, sliders, and other complex physics interactions within your projects. <br>
This documentation will guide you through the process of using Boxed Physics.

## Working with Worlds
When using the Boxed Physics extension, you must initialize the physics environment before starting your project. To do this, use the `Make world, Scale 1m: [SCALE] Gravity: [GRAVITY] Wind: [WIND] Scene: [SCENE]` block.

> Note: the environment is initialised to the default every time the project starts, but it's good practice to use this block every flag click anyways

### Scene Types
The scene type determines the containment type for your physics world:
- **Semi-closed stage:** Prevents objects from leaving the bottom and sides of the stage but allows infinite upward movement.
- **Boxed stage:** Fully contains objects within the stage, preventing them from leaving the top, bottom, or sides.
- **Opened stage:** Only prevents objects from falling off the bottom.
- **Nothing:** Removes all walls, allowing objects to move freely.

```scratch
when gf clicked
Make world, Scale 1m: [50] Gravity: [-10] Wind: [0] Scene: [semi-closed stage v] :: #2cb0c0
```

### Changing World Options
Once the world is created, you can modify gravity and wind dynamically without creating a new world.

```scratch
when gf clicked
forever
    Set world options, Gravity: (-10) Wind: ((5) * ([sin v] of ((timer) * (70)))) :: #2cb0c0
end
```

Additionally, you can enable slow motion using the `Set slow motion to [VALUE]` block.

## Creating Your First Object
Objects in Boxed Physics are invisible physics-based hitboxes. To add an object, define its shape and attributes, and then create it in the world.

### Basic Box Example
```scratch
when gf clicked
Dеfine Box, Width: [100] Height: [100] :: #2cb0c0
Make object [Object1] at X: [0] y: [0] Dir: [90] :: #2cb0c0
forever
    Step Simulation :: #2cb0c0 //Remember to run this block every tick
end
```

You can create multiple objects efficiently:
```scratch
when gf clicked
Dеfine Box, Width: [100] Height: [100] :: #2cb0c0
set [index v] to (0)
repeat (4)
    change [index v] by (1)
    Make object (join [Object] (index)) at X: (pick random (-100) to (100)) y: (pick random (-100) to (100)) Dir: [90] :: #2cb0c0
end
```

### Other Shapes

#### Circles
```scratch
Dеfine Circle, Size: [100] :: #2cb0c0
Make object [Object1] at X: [0] y: [0] Dir: [90] :: #2cb0c0
```

#### Polygons
1. **Costume-based:** Directly convert the current costume into a polygon (no holes).
2. **Point-based:** Define polygons with a list of coordinates.

```scratch
Dеfine polygon as this costume :: #2cb0c0
Make object [Object2] at X: [50] y: [50] Dir: [0] :: #2cb0c0

Dеfine polygon, Points: [0 50   40 -50   -40 -50] :: #2cb0c0 // Triangle
Make object [Object3] at X: [0] y: [0] Dir: [90] :: #2cb0c0
```

> Point-based objects simply take an array of "x y" values seperated by 3 spaces. You can visualise any point-based polygon in [this demo](https://p7scratchextensions.pages.dev/view/demo?p=%2Fext%2FBoxedPhysics%2Fexamples%2FBoxedPhysics%20point%20render%20system.pmp).

### Defining Base Attributes
Customize objects with the `Define base` block:
- **Type** Determines if the object is static or dynamic.
- **Density, Friction, Bounce** Control physical properties like weight, surface interaction, and bounciness.

```scratch
when gf clicked //Super bouncy imovable triangle
Dеfine polygon, Points: [0 50   40 -50   -40 -50] :: #2cb0c0
Dеfine base, Type: [static v] Density: [0.1] Friction: [0.5] Bounce: [2] :: #2cb0c0
Make object [Object1] at X: [0] y: [0] Dir: [90] :: #2cb0c0
```

---

## Modifying Objects

### Damping (air resistance)
The damping of each object can also be changed with the `Set [BODYATTR] of object [NAME] to [VALUE]` block.

```scratch
when gf clicked
Set [damping v] of object [Object1] to [0.1] :: #2cb0c0
```

### Destroying Objects
You can delete individual objects or clear all objects at once.
```scratch
when I receive [Destroy Object1 v]
Destroy object [Object1] :: #2cb0c0

when I receive [Nuke everything! v]
Destroy every object :: #2cb0c0 //This will also remove all joints
```

### Moving Objects

#### Direct Movement
```scratch
Move object [Object1] to X: [50] Y: [50] :: #2cb0c0
Set rotation of object [Object1] to [45] :: #2cb0c0
```

#### Velocity and Impulse
Rotational impulses are simple, just a number for power, but positional impulses are a little more complex. <br>
Positional impulses can be one of two types: `World Impulse` or `Impulse`.
They both take a direction, and power, but they behave differently.
The `Impulse` option is meant for quick movements (like jumping)
while the `World Impulse` option is meant for movement over time (like pushing a wheel).

```scratch
Set Velocity of object [Object1] to X: [10] Y: [0] Dir: [0] :: #2cb0c0
Apply Angular Impulse to object [Wheel1] power: [20] :: #2cb0c0
```

## Handling Impacts
Boxed Physics comes with a few blocks that can be used to handle impacts.

### On impact
When an object collides with another, this hat block is triggered.
This simple block allows you to run code any time an object is hit.

> Note: this block does not restart existing threads

```scratch
When [Object] has an impact :: #2cb0c0
say [I HAVE BEEN HIT!]
```

You can also use a boolean version that returns true if an object had an impact during the last tick.

```scratch
when gf clicked
wait until <[Object] had an impact :: #2cb0c0>
say [I got hit during the last tick]
```

### What hit me?
You can also check what objects are colliding with the `Get all objects touching [NAME]` block.
This block simply lists all the names that hit the object.

```scratch
When [Object1] has an impact :: #2cb0c0
say (join [I was hit by ] (Get all objects touching [Object1] :: #2cb0c0))
```

Or you can just get if the object is touching anyting if you don't care what was hit.

```scratch
when gf clicked
forever
    if <[Object] is touching anything :: #2cb0c0> then
        say [AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!]
    else
        say []
    end
end
```

## Making Joints
Joints connect objects and enable complex interactions like wheels, sliders and more. <br>
Here is a description of all joints in BoxedPhysics:

**Rotating:** This joint lets you to join 2 objects togeather while keeping rotations

**Weld:** This joint locks 2 objects togeather, making them act like one object

**Spring:** This joint keeps 2 objects at a semi-fixed distance from eachother

**Slider:** This joint forces an object to only move along the specified axis to the other object

**Pin:** This joint takes an object and tries to move it to a position with a specified force. 
This joint is the only joint to have the input position stay relative to the world instead of the object.<br>
Creating pin joints uses its own block, instead of the create joint block


```scratch
Dеfine Spring, Length: [100] Damping: [0.7] Freq: [5] :: #2cb0c0
Create Joint [Spring1] of type [Spring v] between [Object1] at [0] [0] and [Object2] at [0] [0] :: #2cb0c0
```

> Experiment with all the joint types in [this demo](https://studio.penguinmod.com/fullscreen.html?project_url=https://p7scratchextensions.pages.dev/ext/BoxedPhysics/examples/Joints.pmp) to see what they do.

### Joint Properties
- **Settable:** Motor On, Speed, Limits, Torque
- **Gettable:** Angle, Speed, Torque, Tension

## Performance Options
You can optimize your simulation by configuring iteration settings to allow for more objets with less lag, or have better physics with fewer objects. <br>
While this doesn't visually change anything _(usually)_ it does change how performant things are, and you will notice that with bigger simulations.

```scratch
Set physics options, Position iterations: [10] Velocity iterations: [10] Continuous physics: <true :: #5EC15D> Warm starting: <true :: #5EC15D> :: #2cb0c0
```

---

## Math Utilities
Boxed Physics also includes some math blocks for convenience:
- **Rotate a point:** Rotate a point around the origin (0, 0).
- **Get rotation from:** Find the direction from one point to another.
- **Magnitude:** Calculate the vector length.
- **Distance:** Measure the distance between two points.

```scratch
(Get [x v] from point x [10] y [-10] rotated by [90] :: #2cb0c0)
(Get rotation from x [0] y [0] to x [10] y [15] :: #2cb0c0)
(Magnitude of x [5] y [3] :: #2cb0c0)
(Distance between x [0] y [0] and x [-20] y [10] :: #2cb0c0)
```
